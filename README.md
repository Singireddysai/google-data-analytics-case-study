# google-data-analytics-case-study

This is the case study that i did for my google data analytics certificate.
In this repository the main file is the html documetation file which describes all the analysis and the process i did with the recomendations too.And it seems that the html doc is not loading so i'll just give the link  :   file:///C:/Users/acer/Desktop/case%20study1/documentation.html
the r case study file is the code that i used for analysis.
The documentation rmd file is the documentation file in r markdown
there is also a txt file which i made during my analysis just so i dont lose my track
